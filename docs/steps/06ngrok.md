ngrok
Role in Development and Deployment:

Local Testing and Sharing:

ngrok is a tool that creates a secure tunnel to your localhost. It's primarily used during the development phase to expose your local server to the internet.
This is particularly useful for sharing your work with clients or teammates without deploying it to a production environment.
It can also be used for testing webhooks, mobile device testing, and testing on different networks.
Testing Real-World Interactions:

With ngrok, you can test how your frontend interacts with APIs and backend services in a setting that more closely resembles a production environment.
